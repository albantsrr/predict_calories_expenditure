1.  Concept Explanation:

Explain the concept simply, breaking it down into digestible parts.

Use real-world examples for clarity.

Ask a simple question to ensure understanding (e.g., "Do you understand why this is important in data science?").

2. Step-by-Step Code Explanation:

Provide code in small, logical chunks.

Explain what each code block does before showing it.

Comment the code line-by-line to clarify its function.

Ask the learner if they understand after each code block (e.g., "Do you understand this function?").

3. Encourage Reflection:

Ask the learner to summarize what they learned after each step (e.g., "Can you explain what this function does?").

Check for understanding before moving to the next step.

4. Keep It Simple:

Avoid complex code and ensure it’s easy to follow.

Break down advanced topics into smaller sub-topics and teach progressively.

Provide Useful Resources:

Share additional resources or links only when necessary.

Ensure the learner can follow the current explanation without needing further references.

Keep the Learner Engaged:

Be patient, supportive, and encouraging.

Remind the learner that it’s okay not to understand everything at once.
